Service Agreement and End User License Agreement 


Service provided by InReach LLC or Roadpost, Inc. dba InReach Canada may become limited or 
temporarily unavailable without notice from time to time due to any number of reasons associated with

reception limitations. Further information regarding service coverage and potential interruptions can be 
found in the Terms of Service (as defined below) available at explore.delorme.com.

total, maximum aggregate value not to exceed the amount of service fees paid by you. Further 
information concerning the limitations of liability for use of this product and service can be found in the

1) NOTICE TO USER / ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS. 


PLEASE READ THESE LEGAL NOTICES CAREFULLY. BY USING YOUR INREACH PRODUCT FOR 
INREACH AND/OR THE SERVICE, YOU ACCEPT ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THESE 
DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE LEGAL AGREEMENTS AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE 
BEEN INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, THE INREACH 
PRODUCT LIMITED WARRANTY, THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND THE END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT 
(EULA) AND ANY AND ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND/OR DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY 
CONTAINED THEREIN. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU MUST BE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18)

NOTICES ARE ENFORCEABLE LIKE ANY WRITTEN AGREEMENT SIGNED BY YOU. IF YOU DO NOT 
AGREE, DO NOT USE THE INREACH PRODUCT AND PROMPTLY RETURN IT TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU 
OBTAINED IT. 


2) USE OF YOUR INREACH PRODUCT. 


2.1 Familiarization with your INREACH Product. You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to 
familiarize yourself with the operation of your INREACH Product, INREACH Smartphone Applications, and DeLorme 
GPS device (PN-60w or subsequent model), including reading your User Manual, available at 

manuals.delorme.com. You agree that you will use the INREACH Product only in accordance with those 
instructions. It is also highly recommended that you review the Help available at explore.delorme.com and practice 
properly using your INREACH Product by sending test messages and fixing your GPS coordinates as described. 


2.2 Coverage. You may use your INREACH Product, INREACH Smartphone Applications, and DeLorme GPS 
device anywhere there is coverage (subject to the applicable restrictions due to local laws, licensing/certification 
requirements and regulations. For a complete list of the certifications applicable to your INREACH Product and/or 
the DeLorme GPS Device, please see the device User Manual at manuals.delorme.com. 


2.3 Important Tips. Your INREACH Product needs a clear view of the sky to obtain a GPS signal and provide the 
most accurate location information. It is not reliable indoors or in a cave. Orienting your INREACH Product so that 
the protruding antenna is oriented to the sky will improve performance, and you should keep your INREACH 
Product at least 12 inches away from other GPS devices and mobile phones. Please read your Quick Start Guide or 
User Manual and follow the instructions to pair your DeLorme GPS device or INREACH Smartphone Application with 
your INREACH Product. 


2.4 Message Schedule. Redundancy is built into your INREACH Product to ensure more of your messages are 
transmitted. It is normal for some INREACH messages to be blocked by everyday conditions; the view of the sky is 
often blocked due to hills, buildings, or other obstructions. This is why InReach automatically retries messages 
until it receives a satellite acknowledgement. Placement of your INREACH unit can make a difference. Experiment 
with placement until you are familiar with the reliability of your operating environment. 


3) 


2.5 Synchronization of Data. You acknowledge that it is your sole responsibility to ensure that you have 
followed the synchronization process outlined on explore.delorme.com to export any updates and/or changes to
