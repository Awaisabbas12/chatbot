Itâs gone through an extensive drafting process with leading law firms and in-house lawyers from around the world to produce a simple, easy to use NDA - and it looks good too.\nDownload for Free\nHow we started oneNDA\nAdopt oneNDA. Itâs the right thing to do.\nHereâs why: Less than 1% of NDAs ever get litigated. And if they do, theyâre almost impossible to enforce. The ROI is not proportionate to the effort we expend on them. They cost companies millions every year - money they could spending on better, more important things. Adopting oneNDA is free and always will be. Lots of other amazing companies have already adopted it which means itâs a goodie.\nNDAs are super boring. Lawyers didnât study to law to review NDAs. The business will not thank you if you redline the heck out of an NDA. By adopting oneNDA you become cooler than those who have not adopted oneNDA. oneNDA is a movement and by adopting it, youâre helping transform the world of law.\nAdopt oneNDA ->\nAdopter Centre ->\nJoin thousands of organisations that use our template to streamline and automate the NDA process.\nDownload for Free\nSign up to our newsletter\nGet all the latest oneNDA news straight to your inbox.
