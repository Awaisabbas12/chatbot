MEMORANDUM FOR: Director. of Security 


THROUGH: Deputy Director of Security (P&M) 


FROM: 


Chief, Special Security Center 


SUBJECT: Non-disclosure Agreement (NdA) 


1. Prior to implementation of the Director of Security's 


instructions concerning the NdA, the following considerations 
are offered: . 


A) It should be clearly understood that the DDCI 
has not, repeat, not mandated the use of Form 4193. He 
merely indicated that an NdA should be utilized. CIA 
already has one in Form 4066. If the Department of 


‘Defense, whose investigative Service is unable to pro- 


vide timely DCID 1/14 investigations, wishes to wrap 
itself around the axle by using 4193 and maintaining 
them for 70 years, there is no compelling reason tor 
CIA to emulate this lunacy. 


B) Any attempt to "retrofit", either at the staff 
employee, level [= lor the contractor level STAT 
would be an intolerable administrative burden and wou 
expose the Office and the Agency to deserved ridicule 
and abuse. This is especially true for our non-NFIB 
customers whose numbers and high rank speak for themselves: 
(the asterisk indicates Cabinet level officers - many others 
are Presidential appointees) 


*Department of Agriculture 203 
*Department of Commerce 181 
*Department of Labor 6 
*Department of Transportation — 33 
*Department of the Interior 237

2. It is strongly recommended that Form 4193 join the 
rest of the APEX initiatives in the dustbin of history and . 
that CIA continue to utilize Form 4066 as its NdA.
