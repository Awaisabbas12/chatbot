*There were five substantive objectives submitted by the DCI with his letter to the 
President of June 18, 1974. They were not numbered; but the order in which they appear here, 
and hence the ordering of these groups of Key Intelligence Questions, follows the sequence 
of that June 18 submission.

Key Intelligence Questions 


For FY 1975 


Introduction 


1. These Key Intelligence Questions are designed to be responsive to and 

to support the Substantive Objectives of the Intelligence Community for FY 

, 1975 as noted by the United States Intelligence Board on June 13, 1974, prior 
to the submission of those Objectives to the President. 


2. The Key Intelligence Questions for Fiscal Year 1975 are issued as guidance 
to the Intelligence Community for the collection and production of intelligence 
on subjects of major importance to national-level intelligence consumers during 
FY 1975. These Key Intelligence Questions obviously do not exhaust the uni- 
verse of consumer needs; there are additional important categories of intelligence 
collection and production which are not included in this priority national in- 
telligence guidance: 


(a) Lower priority national intelligence subjects: These are deliber- 
ately omitted in order to emphasize the importance of the Key Intelligence 
Questions. It is recognized that some attention must be devoted to lower 
priority subjects, such as developments in Africa, although wherever pos- 
sible less expensive and less difficult collection techniques should be em- 
ployed. A level of attention must also be devoted to countries and issues 
| deemed likely to become important some years from now, even though 
they may not pose immediate or pressing major problems during FY 1975. 


(b) Departmental and tactical intelligence: This includes the intelli- 
gence requirements of the operational commanders, as well as certain 
warning and surveillance activities. An appropriate portion of the national 
| intelligence effort must be devoted to meeting these needs, and the Na- 
: tional Foreign Intelligence Budget Recommendations will take them into 
: account. Continuing efforts will be made to improve the interaction and 
, mutual support of national and tactical intelligence programs so that the 

needs of each level may be served by the same activities to the maximum 
| extent possible. In framing these Key Intelligence Questions for FY 1975, 
careful consideration was also paid to departmental objectives with na- 
tional implications or overtones. The Critical Near-Term Defense Intelli- 
gence Objectives of the Department of Defense were given special attention. 


3. The Key Intelligence Questions are circulated for the following purposes: 


(a) First, to insure that these subjects are given priority in the regular 
collection and production activities of appropriate elements of the Intelli- 
gence Community. 


Approved FABelease 2000/08/30. CIA-RDPS@M01500R000200110052-4 


(b) Second, to enable review of collection and production planning 
by the member agencies of the Intelligence Community via a brief, succinct 
report prepared on each KIQ under the aegis of the appropriate National 
Intelligence Officer. In a few cases involving subjects of particular im- 
portance, a supplementary, more detailed review will highlight specific 
matters deemed appropriate for special collection or production attention. 


(c) Third, to provide the basis for a recapitulation and evaluation, 
after the close of the fiscal year, of the performance of the Intelligence 
Community—and of individual agencies—on each of the Key Intelligence 
Questions. 


(d) Fourth, to permit the conclusions drawn from the recapitulation 
and evaluation of the FY 1975 effort to be used as factors in Community 
resource allocations, and in the preparation of the National Foreign In- 
telligence Budget Recommendations which the Director of Central Intelli- 
gence will be sending to the President in November 1976. 


4, The Key Intelligence Questions have been grouped, where possible, 
under one of the five Substantive Objectives for the Intelligence Community 
as submitted to the President by the Director of Central Intelligence. The 
order in which the FY 1975 questions are listed should not be regarded as 
implying an internal priority: by definition, all the Key Intelligence Questions 
are of major importance. 


5, Additions or modifications to the Key Intelligence Questions may be 
issued from time to time during FY 1975, if major changes in the international 
situation or the foreign intelligence environment should so dictate.
