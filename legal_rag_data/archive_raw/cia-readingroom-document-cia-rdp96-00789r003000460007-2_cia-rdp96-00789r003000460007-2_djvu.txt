consistent with efficient contract performance, the Contractor shall 
perform the following functions: 

{1) Assist small business and small disadvantaged business concerns by 
arranging solicitations, time for the preparation of bids, quantities, 
specifications, and delivery schedules so as to facilitate the 
participation by such concerns. Where the Contractor’s lists of 
potential small business and small disadvantaged subcontractors are 
excessively long, reasonable effort shall be made to give all such small

(2) Provide adequate and timely consideration of the potentialities of 
small business and small disadvantaged business concerns in all 
“make-or-buy" decisions.

incorporated by reference as a part of the subcontracting plan required of 
the offeror by this clause; provided, (1) the master plan has been 
approved, (2) the offeror provides copies of the approved master plan and 
evidence of its approval to the Contracting Officer, and (3) goals and any 
deviations from the master plan deemed necessary by the Contracting 
Officer to satisfy the requirements of this contract are set forth in the 
individual subcontracting plan. 

(g)(1) If a commercial product is offered, the subcontracting plan 
required by this clause may relate to the offeror’s production generally, 
for both commercial and noncommercial products, rather than solely to the 
Government contract. In these cases, the offeror shall, with the 
concurrence of the Contracting Officer, submit one company-wide or 
division-wide annual plan. ’ 

(2) The annual plan shall be reviewed for approval by the agency 
awarding the offeror its first prime contract requiring a subcontracting 
plan during the fiscal year, or by an agency satisfactory to the 
Contracting Officer. 

(3) The approved plan shall remain in effect during the offeror’s 
fiscal year for all of the offeror’s commercial products. 

(h) Prior compliance of the offeror with other such subcontracting plans 
under previous contracts will be considered by the Contracting Officer in 
determining the responsibility of the offeror for award of the contract. 

(i) The failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to comply in good 
faith with (1) the clause of this contract entitled "Utilization of Small 
Business Concerns and Small Disadvantaged Business Concerns," or (2) an

contract.

state or local law, or with an existing collective bargaining 
agreement; provided that with respect to the latter, the Contractor 
agrees that those issues that are in conflict will be a subject of 
negotiation at the next collective bargaining session.
