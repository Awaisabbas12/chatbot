develop sources, generally in the United States, who knew the indi- 
vidual overseas -in order to cover significant employment, education 
or residence and to “attempt to determine if any lasting foreign 
contacts or connections were established during this period. 
However, in all .cases where an individual has worked or lived 
outside of ‘the U-S. continuously for over one year, the investi- 
gation will be expanded ‘to cover fully this period in his or her

paragraph 6 (Personnel Security Standards) above are met (See Annex 
A). 

m. A personal interview of the individual may be conducted, by 
trained security, investigative or counterintelJigence personnel, 
to ensure full investigative coverage. A personal interview will 
be conducted when necessary. to resolve any significant adverse 

“{nformatton and/or -inconsistencies developed during the investi- 
gation. In departments or agencies with policies sanctioning the 
use of the polygraph for personne] security purposes, the personal 
interview may include a polygraph examination, conducted by a 


qualified polygraph examiner. 


_ Exceptions to Investigative Requirements... 


12... In exceptional. cases, the SOIC or his designee may determine 
that it is necessary or advisable inthe National ‘interest to authorize 
access to CI prior to completion of the fully prescribed investigation 
noted in paragraph 11 above. In this situation, such investigative 
checks as are immediately possible shall be made dt ‘once and shall 
include a personal interview of the individual by trained security: 
investigative, or counterintelligence personnel. Access in Such cases 
shall be strictly controlled and the fully prescribed investigation and 


final evaluation shall be completed at the earliest practicable moment. 


| Certification to other organizations .of individuals authorized access 


in such cases shall include explicit notification of the exception. 
13. Where a previous investigation has been conducted within the 
past five (5) years which substantially meets the above minimum 


standards, it may serve as a basis for granting access approval provided

‘a review of the personnel and security files does not reveal substantive 
changes in the individual's security eligibility. If a previous inves- 
tigation does not substantially meet the minimum standards or if it is 
more than five (5) years old, a current investigation shall be required 
but may be limited to that necessary to bring the individual's file 
up-to-date in accordance with the investigative requirements set forth 
jin paragraph 11 above. Should new information be developed during the 
current investigation which bears unfavorably upon the individual's 
activities covered by the previous investigation, the current inquiries 
shall be expanded as necessary to develop full details of this 
information. 


Periodic Reinvestigations. 

14. Programs shall be instituted requiring the periodic reinves- 
tigation of personne) provided access to SCI. These reinvestigations 
shall be conducted on a five (5) year recurrent basis, but on a more 
frequent basis where the individual has shown some questionable behav- 
ioral pattern, his or her activities are otherwise suspect, or when 
deemed necessary by the SOIC concerned. - 

15. The scope of reinvestigations shall be determined by the SOIC 
concerned based on such considerations as the potential damage that 
might result from the individual's defection or willful compromise of 
SCI and the availability and probable effectiveness of other means to 

continually evaluate factors related to the individual's suitability for 
continued access. The individual shall furnish an up-to-date, signed 
personal history statement and signed releases as necessary. In all- 


cases, the reinvestigation shall include, as a minimum, appropriate

national agency checks, local agency checks, (including overseas checks 
where appropriate), credit checks and a personal interview with the 
individual by trained investigative, security or counterintelligence 

- personnel when necessary to resolve significant adverse information 
and/or inconsistencies. When conditions so indicate, additional 
investigation may be conducted as determined by the SOIC or his 
designee. 

16. Determination of Access Eligibility. The evaluation of the 
information developed by investigation on an individual's loyalty and 
suitability shall be accomplished under the cognizance of the SOIC 
concerned by analysts of broad knowledge, good judgment and wide expe- 
rience in personnel security and/or counterintelligence. When all 
other information developed on an individual is favorable, a minor 
investigative requirement which has not been met should not preclude 
favorable adjudication. In al] evaluations the protection of the 
National interest is paramount. Any doubt concerning personnel having 
access to SCI should be resolved in favor of the National eecurtty and 
the access should be denied or revoked. . The ultimate determination of 
whether the granting of access is clearly consistent with the interest 
of National security shall be an overall common sense determination 
based on all available information. | 

17. Appeals Procedures. Annex B prescribes common appeals 
procedures to be followed when an individual's SCI access has been 


denied or revoked.

Continuing Security Programs. 
18. In order to facilitate attainment of the highest standard of 


personnel security and to -augment both the access approval criteria and 
the investigative requirements established by this Directive, member 
departments and agencies shall -institute continuing security programs 
for all ‘individuals having access to SCI. In addition to security 
indoctrinations (See Annex C, "Minimum Standards for SCI Security 
Awareness Programs in the U.S. Intelligence Community"), . these programs 
shall be tailored to create mutually supporting procedures under which 
no issue will escape notice or be left unresolved which brings into 
question an individual's loyalty and integrity or suggests the possi- 
bility of his or her being subject to undue influence or duress through 
foreign relationships or exploitable personal conduct. When an indivi- 
dual-is assigned ‘to perform sensitive compartmented work requiring 
access to SCI, the SOIC for the department, agency, or Government 
program to which the individual is assigned shall assume security 
supervision of that individual throughout the period of his assignment. 
-- 49. The continuing security programs shall include: ae 
~ a. Individuals are required to inform the department or 
agency which.granted their SCI access about any personal . 
problem oF situation which may have a possible bearing on their 
eligibility for continued access to SCI and to seek appropriate 
guidance and assistance. ‘Security counseling should be made 
available. This counseling should be conducted by individuals 


having extensive background and experience regarding the nature

discharge their special responsibility to safeguard SCI, 
including the need to asséss continued eligibility for SCI 
access. These programs ‘shall provide practical guidance on 

oe indicators which may signal matters of security concern. 

Specific instructions concerning reporting procedures shall be 

_ disseminated to enable the appropriate authority to take timely 

ne ‘corrective action to safeguard the security of the United | 
States as well as to provide all necessary help to the indi- 
vidual concerned to neutralize his or her vulnerability.

status, appropriate investigation shall be conducted on a timely 5 


basis. The investigation shall be of sufficient scope necessary to

in question so that a determination can be made as to whether the indi- 
vidual's continued utilization in activities requiring SCI is clearly 
consistent with the interest of the National security. 

21. Security Violations. Individuals determined to have disclosed 
classified information to any person not officially authorized to receive 
it may be eoneidered ineligible for initial or continued SCI access. 
Determination will be based on an evaluation of all available 
information, including whether the disclosure was knowing, wilful, negli- 
gent or inadvertent. A determination of ineligibility for individuals 
who currently hold SCI access shall result in immediate debriefing and 
termination of access for cause. 

22. Implementation. Existing directives, regulations, agreements 
and other guidance governing access to SCI as defined herein shall be 


revised accordingly.

ANNEX A 

DCID 1/14 ADJUDICATION GUIDELINES 

‘PURPOSE 

This annex’ is designed to ensure that a common approach is followed by 

‘Intelligence Conmunity Departments and Agencies in applying the standards of 
(DCID 1/14.. These guidelines apply to ‘the-adjudication of cases involving 
‘persons being considered for first ‘time access’ to Sensitive Compartmented 
‘Information (SCI) as well.as ‘those cases of ‘persons being readjudicated for 
“continued SCI access. 

/ADJUDICATIVE PROCESS © 722-2 27 

: The adjudicative process entails the examination of a sufficient period 
of a person's life to make a determination that the person is not now or is 
not likely to later become an unacceptable security risk. SCI access 
adjudication is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the 
| “whole person" concept. The recency of occurrence of any adverse incident, 
together with circumstances pertaining thereto, is central to a fair and 

7 uniform evaluation. Key factors to be. considered in adjudication are the 

| maturity ane responsibility ofthe person- at the ‘time certain acts or 

| violations were committed as well. as any repetition or continuation of such 
! conduct. Each case must be judged on its own merits and final determination 
remains the responsibility of the individual SOIC. Any doubt concerning 
_ personnel having access to SCI shall be resolved in favor of the national 
| security. 

The ultimate determination of whether the granting of SCI access_is 


| clearly consistent with the interests of national security shall be an overall

common sense determination based on all available information. In arriving at 
a decision consistent with the foregoing, the adjudicator must give careful

LOYALTY 
DCID 1/14 establishes the categorical: requirement that, to be eligible 
-for SCI access, an individual must be of unquestioned loyalty-te the United 
“States. 
CLOSE RELATIVES AND ASSOCIATES — . 
DCID 1/14 requires close examination by the SCI adjudicator when members 
of an individual's immediate family and persons to whom he/she is bound by 
“affection or obligation are not citizens of the United States, or their 
“Joyalty or affection is to a foreign power, or they are subject to any form of 
duress by a foreign power, or they advocate the violent overthrow or 


“unconstitutional alteration of the Government of the United States.

“The adjudicator must assess carefully the degree of actual and potential 


influence that such persons may exercise on the individual based on an 


examination of the frequency and nature of personal contact and correspondence 


with and the political sophistication and general maturity of the individual. — 


A recommendation for access disapproval is appropriate if there is an 


indication that such relatives or associates are connected with any foreign 


_ intelligence service. -.- 


When there is a “compelling need" for SCI access for an individual whose 


| family member is a non-U.S. citizen and the background investigation indicates 


: that the security risk is negligible, an exception to paragraph 6b(1) or (2) 


of DCID 1/14 may be recommended. — 
In some circumstances, marriage of an individual holding SCI access 


approval could present an unacceptable security risk. Such individuals are 


required to file intent-to-marry statements. It is the responsibility of the 


- SOIC to advise the individuals of the possible security consequences. If the 


individual marries a non-U.S. citizen, SCI access will be suspended until the 
case is readjudicated unless an appropriate investigation of the spouse, as 
required by Paragraph JIL of DCID 1/14, was conducted with favorable 

results. In readjudicating such cases, the same judgments and criteria as are 


reflected in this section apply. 


HOMOSEXUAL CONDUCT AND SEXUAL PERVERSION 


DCID 1/14 requires that, to be eligible for SCI access, individuals must 
be stable, of excellent character and discretion, and not subject to undue 
influence or duress through exploitable personal conduct. 

Sexual conduct can be a relevant consideration in circumstances _in which 


the conduct indicates a personality disorder or could result in exposing the

individual to direct or indirect pressure because of susceptibility to black- 
mail or coercion as a result of the deviant sexual behavior. Such behavior 
includes: bestiality, fetishism, exhibitionism, necrophilia, nymphomania or 
satyriasis, masochism, sadism, pedophilia, transvestism, and voyeurism. 
Homosexual conduct is also to be considered as a factor in determining an 
individual's stability and susceptibility to undue influence or duress. 

In examining cases involving acts of homosexual conduct or sexual 
perversion, it is relevant to consider the age of the person, the 
voluntariness, and the frequency of such activities, the public nature and the 
recency of the conduct, as well as any other circumstances which may serve to 
aggravate the nature of character of the conduct. A recommendation for 
disapproval is appropriate when, in view of all available evidence concerning 
the individual's history of sexual behavior, it appears that access to SCI 
could pose a risk to the national security. 

COHABITATION . ; 

Cohabitation in and of itself does not preclude SCI access approval. 

The identity of a cohabitant must be ascertained and a determination made 
if such association constitutes an unacceptable security risk based on the 
same criteria as in the section dealing with Close Relatives and Associates. 
Cohabitation with an alien, for example, requires the same scrutiny as 
marriage to an alien. Extra-marital sexual relations are also of legitimate 
concern to the SCI adjudicator when the potential for undue influence or 
duress exists. 

UNDESIRABLE CHARACTER TRAITS 
It is emphasized that an individual's lifestyle is examined only in an 


effort to determine whether a pattern of behavior exists which indicates that

iy 


Approved For Release 2006/01/03 : CIA-RDP87B01034R000500140032-1 


granting SCI access could pose a risk to national security. In cases where 
allegations have been reported which reflect unfavorably on the reputation of 
an individual, it is incumbent upon the SCI adjudicator to distinguish fact 
fron opinion and to determine which negative characteristics are real and 
pertinent to an evaluation of the individual's character and which are 
unsubstantiated or irrelevant. Relevant negative characteristics are those 
which, in the adjudicator's -informed opinion, ‘indicate that an individual is

‘personal likes or dislikes must. not be permitted to affect the determination. 
| -... Examples of. specific. concern -in determining whether an individual has 
undesirable character traits are any substantive, credible, derogatory 
comments by associates, employers, neighbors and other acquaintances; any 
litigation instituted against the individual by such persons as a result of 
the individual's actions; or allegations of violations of law. A | 
‘recommendation for disapproval would be appropriate for an individual who: 
‘cannot be relied upon to obey rules and regulations. 

3 In examining the circumstances of. cases involving incidents of 
untruthfulness, ‘the adjudicator must weigh all factors with particular 
emphasis on establishing the intent of the “individual. Where an individual 
has tried to obscure pertinent or. significant facts by falsifying data, i.e., 
‘on the Personal History Statement by either omission or false entry, such 
action should be weighed heavily against recommending access. Failure to 
disclose derogatory personal information, such as a court martial or serious 
(crime, would appear to be intentional and, consequently, would warrant a 


recommendation for disapproval.

FINANCIAL IRRESPONSIBILITY 

Financial irresponsibility represents a serious concern to the SCI 
adjudicator. Persons who have engaged in espionage for monetary gain 
demonstrate the hazard of granting SCI access to an individual with overly 
expensive tastes and habits or living under the pressure of serious debt. 

A recommendation for disapproval is appropriate when there is a pattern 
of financial irresponsibility and it appears that an individual has not made a 
conscientious effort to satisfy creditors. In such cases, the adjudicator 
should determine whether the individual had been notified about the debts and 
whether they were legally valid or ultimately satisfied. 

When the financial irresponsibility alone is not of such magnitude to 
warrant disapproval, it may contribute to recommendation for denial of SCI 
access when there is other evidence of irresponsibility. 

ALCOHOL ABUSE 

The SCI adjudicator should examine any information developed relative to 
an individual's use of alcoholic beverages to determine the extent to which 
such use would adversely affect the ability of the individual to exercise the 
care, judgment, and discretion necessary to protect Stl information. The 
adjudicator should determine whether a pattern of impropriety exists, although 
one incident caused by alcohol abuse may be of such magnitude to warrant a 
recommendation for disapproval. 

In determining the security impact of a person’ S pattern of alcohol use, 
the adjudicator should consider the circumstances, amount and rate of 
consumption, the time and place of consumption, and the physiological and 
behavioral effect such drinking has on the individual. For example, does the 


individual's drinking result in absences from work or careless work habits?

' 


Approved For Release 2006/01/03 : CIA-RDP87B01034R000500140032-1 


Does the individual become talkative, abusive or manifest other undesirable 


characteristics? Does the individual drink until. intoxicated? Has the 


_ individual been arrested for any acts resulting from the influence of alcohol? 


In the absence of conclusive evidence, additional insight may be 


available from appropriate medical authorities. If the individual acknowl- 


_ edges having an alcohol abuse problem and is seeking help, it may be 


. appropriate to. defer. access determination and monitor the individual's __ 


.progress for a year or SO- ae 


If, after considering the nature and sources of the information, the 


adjudicator. determines that an individual’ s drinking is not serious enough to 


warrant a recomendation for disapproval of SCI access, it may be appropriate 


. to recommend approval with a warning at the time of indoctrination that future 


.. incidents of alcohol abuse may result in SCI denial. The adjudicator may also 


‘recommend a reinvestigation of the individual's use of alcohol after an 


appropriate period of time has passed. 


. ILLEGAL DRUGS AND DRUG ABUSE 


mane 


The SCI adjudicator. should examine ‘ai allegations of an individual's 


. use, transport, transfer, sale, cultivation, processing and manufacturing of 
- hallucinogens, narcotics, drugs and other materials and chemical EOMPOUNS 
identified and listed in the Controlled Substance Act of 1970, as amended. 


_ Consequently .an individual's involvement in any of these activities is of 


direct concern to the SCI adjudicator in order to determine the individual's 


capability to exercise the care, discretion, and judgment required to protect 


SCI information. The use of these substances may lead to varying degrees of 


’ physical or psychological dependence as well as having a deleterious effect on 


-. an individual's mental state and ability to function.

Persons involved in drug trafficking, i.e., the commercial cultivation, 
processing, manufacturing, purchase or sale of such substances should normally 
be recommended for disapproval. 

In cases involving the use of drugs, the adjudicator must consider the 
nature of the substance used and whether the use is experimental or 
habitual. The frequency, recency and circumstances surrounding said use are 
key elements. For example, has the individual used "hard" drugs or 
hallucinogens such as heroin, cocaine or LSD? Has the individual used drugs 
regularly or only on occasion? Does the individual currently use drugs? Does 
the individual regularly purchase drugs or participate merely when offered 
drugs by others? Has the individual's behavior been affected by the use of 
drugs and, if so, to what extent? 

Once the judgment is made that an individual is a habitual user of any 
controlled substance (multiple use beyond the point of mere experimentation), 
a recommendation for disapproval is appropriate. Moreover, even experimental 
use of hard drugs or hallucinogens, such as LSD, could warrant a 
recommendation for disapproval. 

EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL DISORDERS 

DCID 1/14 requires that persons considered for access to SCI be stable, 
trustworthy, reliable, and of excellent character, judgment and discretion. 
Emotional and mental disorders which interfere with an individual's perception 
of reality or reliability are of serious concern to the SCI adjudicator in 
determining whether an individual is able or willing to protect SCI infor- 
mation. 

It is essential to obtain as much information as possible when an 


allegation has been made in this area. If feasible, the individual should

i be interviewed to obtain additional detail. When appropriate, government 
_ psychological and. psychiatric personnel should be consulted so that psychi- 
_ atric or psychological data may be proper ly evaluated. 
: If a current emotional instability appears to be a temporary conditions. 
- for example, caused by a death, illness or marital breakup, it may be 
_ advisable to reconmend postponing final action and rechecking ‘the situation at 
| a later date. This-precludes a security disapproval for what may be a 
- temporary condition which, ‘when :cured, would ‘have no security implications. 
Military and civilian personnel who decline to take medical/psychiatric 
_ tests when so directed by competent authority should not be recommended for 
— SCI access. 
_ RECORD OF LAW VIOLATIONS: © ~ 

In determining whether an individual is stable, trustworthy, of excellent 
character, judgment -and discretion as required by DCID 1/14 for access to SCI, 
_ the adjudicator must weigh carefully any record of law violations by the 
individual. Although a pattern of repeated minor traffic violations could be 
significant, the adjudicator is principally concerned with more serious 
criminal violations .or court actions reflecting adversely upon the 
individual's reliability or trustworthiness. ~~ | 
. .F Each case involving convictions for :criminal offenses must be considered 
from the standpoint of the -nature ‘and seriousness of the offense, the cir- 
cumstances under which it occurred, how-long ago it occurred, whether it was 
an isolated offense or a repeated violation of the law, the offender's age at 
the time, social conditions which may have a bearing on the individual 


actions, and any evidence of rehabilitation.

Approved For Release 2006/01/03 : CIA-RDP87B01034R000500140032-1 


Any conviction for a felony will normally support a recommendation for 
disapproval. If the offense was committed many years prior, the individual 
has shown evidence of rehabilitation, and the investigation shows no other 
derogatory information, an approval may be considered. A large number of 
minor offenses, however, could indicate irresponsibility and may support an 
adverse recommendation. ° 
SECURITY VIOLATIONS 

Most security violations are caused by.carelessness or ignorance with no 
intention of compromising security. However, the record of an individual 
responsible for ‘multiple violations should be scrutinized. The individual's 
current attitude toward security should be confirmed with his/her 
supervisor. A pattern of violations may be sufficient ground for a 
recommendation for disapproval. individuals responsible for unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information may be denied initial or continued SCI 


access.
