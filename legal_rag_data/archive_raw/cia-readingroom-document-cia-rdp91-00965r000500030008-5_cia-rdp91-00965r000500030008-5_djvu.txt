WRITTEN STATEMENT OF MR. LOYD WRIGHT, 
CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMESSION ON GOVERNMENT 
SECURITY, FILED WITH THE POST OFFICE AND 
’ CIVIL SERVICE COMMITTER, U. S. HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES, CONCERNING H.R. 8322, 
H.R. 8323, and HeR. 833). 


Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee on Post Office and 
Civil Service. In my oral statement, I sunmarlaed for the Committee 
the reasoning behind some of the principal recommendations of the 
Commission as set forth in its Report transmitted to the Congress and 
the President on June 21, and as embodied in the Bills before you. 
the purpose of this additional statement is to enlarge upon my oral 
statement for the record and to analyze in greater detail the various 
chapters and sections of these Bills. 

The purpose of each of these Bills is stated to be: 

"To establish a Central Security Office to coordinate the 

administration of Federal personnel. loyalty and security 

programs, to prescribe administrative procedure for the 

hearing and review of cases arising under such prograns, 

and for other purposes." 

Each of these Bills is identical with the ansecthen of certain 
differences in Section 10h, concerning which I will refer later. Also, 
with the exception of Section 104, H.R. 8322 and 8323 are identical

with legislation proposed by the Commission beginning on page 691 of 
our report. H.R. 833) is identical with the legislation we stepored: 

Section 2 of each Bill defines certain terms, The definitions 
are generally clear. I would like to point out particularly, however, 
as stated in definition No. (7), that the term Nedvilian employee". 
means any officer or employee of any executive agency other than the 
Central Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency. That 
wording simply means this: The Commission has recommended a program 
for civilian employees based on considerations of loyalty. We further 
reconmend that the procedure of this program extend to all sivilian: | 
enployees with the exception of those employed by the CIA and the NSA. 
These agencies by their very nature must be given the authority to 
depart from normal security practices. Conversiey, they should, of 
course at a minimun observe the basic stendards and criteria relating 
to removal recommended for al employees. 

Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 are concerned with the establishment, 
functions and operation of a Central Security Office, As stated in 
our report, the creation of a Central Security Office is perhaps the 
most important recommendation made by the Commission. We recognize . 
that the implementation of this recommendation would be a major step 
in the administrative machinery of our government. Because of its 
great significance I would like to devote a few moments to discussing 
its necessity and proposed operation. 

In brief, the purpose of the Central Security Office would be to 


provide procedures for the hearing and appeal of security and loyalty

cases and to assist in the coordination of the civilian employees! 
program, the industrial security program, the port security progran, - 
the Commission recommended civil air transport security program, ang: 
the document. classification progran. It would also provide dedeing 
examiners to hear cases concerning organizations the Attorney General 
proposes to designate on the so-called Attorney General's List. TI 
want to make it abundantly clear at the outset that the Central 
Security Office would in all matters be advisory only to the heads of 
the appropriate agencies, It would have no final authority. and its 
recannendations would not be mandatory. Only the President would 
have the authority to drdee chantes in executive operations, The 
Commission studied each of these programs individually and as a con- 
posite whole. Many deficiencies were discovered in the separate 
programs and specific recommendations for correction were made 
accordingly, In addition, our study disélosed many weaknesses that 
ran across the board and could be found in greater or lesser degree 
in all of the programs, Some of these defects were, for example ~= 

1. Lack of uniformity in the preparation and application 

of rules and regulations. 
@. Lack of coordination between agencies and between 
divisions of the same agency, 
3. Duplication of forms and records. 
4. Duplication of investigations and clearances, 


5. Wide dispersion of responsibility among personnel.

6. Lack of training and guidance of personnel. 

7. lack of uniformity in screening procedures. 

8. Lack of uniformi ty in hearing procedures. 

In short, perhaps the outstanding thing sbout, ¢ our various: ‘security 
programs is their nasese eee with one otis . 

‘Thus. for example - -- The hearing boards under the civilian employees! 
: seourlty program ere composed of goverment employees heving regular 
normal duties and responsibilities an their own agencies. ‘The Civil 
Service Gundenton maintains a roster or panel. of more than 1,800 ouch, 
employees who are available when needed consonant with their regular 
agency work. Although they are ‘required to be individuals. of "integrity, ’ 
‘ability and good judgnent,!" certainly fundamental qualifications T hope 
for any employee, there are no special qualifications for service and 
es tredning is required or given, . 7 | | 
| ‘the Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission, on 
the other hand, operate their own hearing boards under the industrial 
security progran; and the Coast Guard has & separate system under the | 
port picid Gy pedenall, At present there ds no air transport security 
peoeran and, of course, no provision for any hearings at all. . 

Now while these prograns are different in many respects and must 
‘of necessity retain certain individuel differences, they do have essen- 
tiel similerities. Each program is concerned with the protection of 
the nation's sanueeey from @ common enemy <= each program deals with 


Andividuals and their right to employment «- each program should be 


=h-

concerned with ensuring that in its basic elements it provides equal 
protection for the nation and equality of treatment for the persons 
it affects. 

Yet despite the fact, that the Federal Government has operated 
these programs for years, there is still no central point of coordi~ 
nation -= no provision for insuring that the programs carry out a 

- Single government policy with some degree of uniformity. 

Similar disparities in operation and lack of uniformity can also 
be found in the matters of screening, selection of security personnel, 
training of security personnel, and even in the basic manuals of rules 
and regulations, | | 

Now I would be ingenuous indeed to deny that these prograns have 
functioned with varying degrees of success, T an confident that 
through the efforts of the heads of the various agencies, assisted by 
their security personnel and the manbers: of hearing boards, that many 
an individual of hyphenated loyalty has been properly renoved from the 
public rolls or denied access to classified information or restricted 
areas, JI realize full well also that there is no advantage in having 
"uniformity" for the sake of "uniformity" itself. Our studies have 
shown unquestionably, however, that these prograis operating sui juris 
have been far from efficient, and, in many instances, have been the 
cause of cruel injustices to individuals and their families because 
of inept handling of individual cases by inexperienced or untrained 
personnel, undue delays, and sanetimes plain ignorence of the govern= 


ment policy involved.

So much for the negative side of the picture. The fact that our 
security programs were the subject of grievous complaint was publicly 
known long before the Commission on Government Security was created. 
In fact, it was because of these complaints that the Commission was 

“brought into being. Let us consider now the positive advantages to 
be obtained by the enactment of the legislation before you. 

Under Chapter 1 of the Bills before you, the Central Security 
Office would be an independent office subject to the direction of the 
Fresident. It would be a small office with a Director, and Assistant 
Director for Hearings, and an Assistant Director for #dministration, 
each of whem would be appointed by the President. There would be a 
Central Review Board consisting of three members, also appointed by 
the President. | 

The hearing examiners would be selected fron a special Civil Ser- 
vice register and wovld be required i‘ meet such special qualifications 
as the Commission prescribes after consultation with the Director. 
Further, each examiner would be obliged to complete a special training 
courses the examiners would be assigned to hear cases under the ci- 
vilien employees loyalty program, the industrial security program, 
the port security progran, and, if the Commission's recommendation is 
followed, under a civil air transport security program to be established, 
As indicated previously, they would also conduct hearings concerning 


organizations proposed for designation on the Attorney General's List.

The Commission felt that the use of specially selected, trained, 
fulltime hearing examiners in such cases is not only an advantage, 
put 4a necessity. The hearing of a loyalty or security issue is a 
grave and often complex matter, The task of sifting evidence; of 
separating truth from falsehood; of evaluating the significance of 
past activities and. associations; of determining the existence or 
nonexistence of reasonable doubt or danger to the common defense and 
security should be entrusted only to specially selected, qualified, 
full-time examiners. Our experience with hearing examiners under 
the Administrative Procedures Act, and with special masters in 
Federal and State Courts, particularly where the issues are compli- 
cated, is ample evidence of the benefits to be expected through their 
Use» 

The use of hearing examiners in the several programs should pro- 
mote eran equitable treatment for persons called before then, 
insure that the Goverment's interests are adequately and continuously 
protected, lessen hearing costs and expedite hearing procedures, 

All other employees including the hearing examiners would be 
appointed subject to Civil Service laws and the Classification Act 
of 199, and to the satisfactory completion of a full field investiga~ 
tion by the Civil Service Commission. 

Chapter 2 provides for coordination of the Loyalty and Security - 
Programsby the Central Security Office. Under Section 20 the Director 


would provide training programs for officers and employees of the 


Se

Office and instructional conferences for the security officers of 
the executive agencies. It is fundamental, of course, that the 
personnel of the Central Security Office itself should be afforded 
training not only in appropriate technical subjects but in constitue 
tional and related matters affecting Federal service. The instruc- 
tion of agency security personnel is similarly important. Today 
there is no governmental training program, formal or informal, and 
the degree of indoctrination and instruction furnished varies from 
agency to agency and program to program. It is not the Commission's 
Suggestion that formal training for security personnel: be provided 
through or conducted by the Central Security Office. It does believe, 
- however, that conferences for the purpose of briefing on current 
problens and discussion will help immeasurably in increasing the 
efficient operation of each program and uniformity throughout. 
. Under Section 21 the Director ould conduct continuing surveys 


and inspections of the regulations and the practices and procedures 


of executive agencies in the operation of loyalty and security programs =" 


including among other matters Screening prectices, training programs, 
and the classification of documents, 
The surveys would be used to determine for example whether existing 


classification procedures result in overclassification of information 


end whether they effectively provide for the declassif ication of informa~ 


tlon when the need for its classification has ended,

This is a matter of vital significance. The tendency of some. 
agencies to overclassify or to retain information in a classified . 
category longer than required must be subject to a continuing chack 
to insure that declassification procedures have been provided. and 
are in fact in operation. The maximum information concerning govern~ 
ment operations must be freely available to the Congress, public and 
the press. It is very important that the Congress, as well as the 
agencies involved, thoreughly understand that it is not the intention 
of the Commission on Goverment Security that the Central Security 
Office emplcyees will have any authority to exanine individual files 
or documents in any agency other than those concerned with such pro- 
cedures and practices, 

Under Section 22 the Director would receive, evaluate and investi- 
gate concedes made by Goverment contractors concerning requirements 
junposed on them for security reasons. The Director would endeavor to 
work out problems with the contractors and the appropriate agencies, 

Under Section 23 the Director wowld compile and maintain statistical 
records concerning essential developments in the loyalty and security 
programs, The compiletion and correlation of statiatics is one of the — 
principal means of judging the operation and effectiveness of any pro~ 
eran, The Commission felt that statistics should be particularly main- 
tained for the use of the Director and for the information of the Congress 
and the President. 

Section 2 is of great importance, It gives the Director the responsi 


pllity to promulgate rules and regulations for the conduct of enployees of

the Central Security Office, for the conduct of hearings and review 
proceedings, and finally, in consultation with the Govermnent deteaee 
ments and agencies, to furnish advice and guidance for the purpose of 
. establishing uniformity in the Loyalty and security siceraas generally. 
The necessity of bringing a high degree of uniformity to the various — 
sets of rules and regulations appeared obvious to the Commission, Tn 
the industrial seourity program, while there are basic industrial 
sanity manuels, each of the three military services issue their own 
interpretative guides and regulations ~- the Atomic Energy Commission 
has its ovm set of regulations. In the Civilian Bnployees! Security 
Program each of the more than 60 departments and agencies issue their 
own regulations. While they are in many ways substantially similer 
to sample regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice in 
April of 1953, there are wide discrepancies and there is no procedure 
for keeping them in line with current overall government policy. While 
the problems of particular agencies and programs necessitate certain 
differences in regulations to meet differing situations, coordination 
through the Central Security Office will help promote uniformity where 
uniformity is needed, particularly in the application of the loyalty 
and security standards and implementing criteria to particular fact 
situations. 

Under Section 25 the Director would be obliged to submit an annual 
report to the Congress and the Fresident on the operation of the Central. 
Security Office and of each loyalty and security progran. You will also 
note that under Section 28 (b):

"Upon request made by the President, the Congress 
or either House thereof, or my duly authorized 
conmittee or subconmitteo of either House of the 
Congress, the Director shall make a special report 
concerning the operation of any loyalty or security 
program." (emphasis supplied) 
The Commission felt that adequate and intelligent reporting is 
essential. The Central Security Office activities should be open 
for inspection, consonant of course with security considerations in- 
volved in individual hearing or appeal cases, Adequate statistical | 
and other reporting will give the Director the opportunity to recom- 
‘mend changes believed needed in the various programs as observed from 
his central vantage point. It will, for the first time, give the 
Congress and the President the opportunity to keep continuously advised 
‘of the developments in and progress of those progrems in order that 
_ corrective steps may be taken as may be indicated a recommended, 
. Chapter 3 provides for hearing and review of loyalty and security 
questions. Section 30 (a) provides that whenever any civilian employee 
‘or applicant for employment is entitled by law or executive order to a 
hearing under the Leva ty. program, the hearing shall be conducted in 
accordance with the provisions of Chapter 8. This would be applicable 
to hearings conducted under the proposed civilian employees loyalty 


progrem described in Chapter h.

Section 30 (b) provides that whenever an individual who is not 

- an employee of an executive agency is entitled under any security 
program to a hearing, that hearing shall also be conducted in 
accordance with the provisions of Chapter 8. This paragraph would 
apply to individuals in connection with the industrial personnel 

. security prograns described in Chapter 5, to individuals under the 
port security program, and to individuals under the air transport 
security program, if the latter is established by legislation as 
recommended by the Commission, . 

Section 30 («) provides for hearings on request of organizations 
which may be designated for inclusion by the Attorney General on the | 
do~called Attorney General's list referred to in Section 60 of these 
Bills. The Commission's recommendation for the retention of the . 
List, with certain modifications, will be discussed later under 
Section 60. | |

Section 31 provides for review Of adverse decisions in any type 
hearing by the Central Review Board which would be located in the 
Central Security Office. The operations of the Central Review Board 
will be discussed later under Chapter 9. 

Chapter 4 outlines the civilian employees loyalty program and the 
procedures to be observed by an executive department or agency in 
determining the loyalty of an employee or an applicant for employment. 
Sections 40 (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) describe the investigative 
reqilrementa. No person would be permitted to enter the Federal civilian 
service until an investigation or national ageney check had been completed 
except where the head of the agency determines an emergency condition 
justifies exception. Tn such a case he would be tendered empLoyment 

conditioned upon a favorable determination as to his loyalty and suit- 
ability upon completion of the investigation. In brief, a national 
agency check would be made with regard to each applicant considered for 
appointment to or employment in any non=sensitive position. A full field 
investigation would be made with regard to an applicant considered for 
‘appointment to or employment in a sensitive position, or in the aes of 
an employee considered for transfer from a non=-sensitive position to a 
sensitive position. Full field investigations would be made, as is the 
present practice in most instances, by the Civil Service Commission with 
the requirement that if an investigation discloses derogatory subversive 
information, the matter shall be referred to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation for a full field investigation by that agency. 
This proposed legislation, which is based upon the Commissionts 


recommendations, retains without substantial changes the desirable 


Approved For Release 2001/03/07-:IGLA-RDP91-00965R000500030008-5 


Approved For Release 2001/03/07 : CIA-RDP91-00965R000500030008-5 


features of the investigative requirements of the former loyalty program 
and the current security program. The loyalty program proposed by the 
Commission and in these Bills can only be as effective as the quality of 
ons loyalty investigations made and the Commission strongly urges that | 
appointment or employment, based upon the completion of an adequate 
investigation and favorable determination, be continued. 

Section 41 provides for the screening and evaluation of information 
contained in reports of investigations of ofvilian employees and appli- 
cants for appointment or employment. In brief, this assignment in each 
agency would be handled by specially qualified personnel. Whenever a 
screening officer determines that a report contains. derogatory informa- 
tion relating to loyalty, the officer shall grant to the individual con- 
cered an opportunity for an interview in which he may offer his explana~ 
tion of that information. Under present practice there is no requirement 
that an employee or applicant be interviewed. The Commissionts survey 
indicated that many cases would never avs. penahad the hearing stage with 
consequent hardship to the individuals involved and needless administrative 
effort and cost to the Government, if opportunity had been given for 
employees to explain certain information in investigative reports, It 
therefore recommended, as these Bills state, that such an interview 
be a mandatory part of the loyalty procedures. 

Tf, following such interview and additional investigation, if needed, 
or in the event an interview is declined, or the screening officer deter~ 
mines that the issuance of a letter of charges is justified, he shall 
prepare and transmit such a letter to the individual which shall be as 
specific and detailed as the interests of the national security permit.

a 


Approved For Release 2001/03/07 : CIA-RDP91 -00965R000500030008-5 


The letter must also advise the individual of his right to a hearing. Before 
the letter is issued, however, the screening officer will obtain the opinion 
oe the appropriate Legal officer of the agency on its sufficiency as outlined 
in Section 41 (d) of the Bills. . 

Under Section 41 (e) if an investigative report discloses information 
indicating that a civilian employee or applicant may be unsuitable on any 
ground other than doubt as to his loyalty, such case will be handled in 
accordance with the regular Civil Service suitability procedures. I should 
note at this time that one of the basic recomnendations of the Commission 
is that loyalty cases be completely divoreed and handled separately from 
cases which involve elements of personal unsuitability for Federal service. 
Under the present security program many of the factors to be considered in 
determining whether an individual is a risk to the national security are 
regular suitability factors and, in fact, the majority of Federal employees 
who have been dismissed under the current program as security risks were 
‘processed under the regular Civil Service procedures. The Commissionts 
recommendation and these Bills thus would prevent the unjust stigmatizing 
of persons actually terminated because of general unsuitability for Federal 
service. | 

Section 42 describes the procedures to be followed in loyalty hearings 
and determinations. In brief, whenever an individual has received a 
letter of charges as described under Section Al, he will have the oppor 
tunity to file a sworn answer thereto and request a hearing upon those 
charges. When a hearing has bean requested the agency screening officer 

' ghall transmit a copy of the letter of cheeses and all papers filed by 


the individual to the Director of the Central Security Office for filing 
and a hearing in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 8. When

Approved For Release 2001/03/07 : CIA-RDP91-00965R000500030008-5 


following a hearing the agency head determines that there is reaggnable 
doubt as to the loyalty of the individual, the latter may make written 
application to the agency head for a review of such determination. The 
agency head shall forward that request, together with all documents and 
records pertinent thereto, to the Director of the Central Security Office 
for review by the Central Review Board. TE the individual fails to make 
timely application for such a review, the agency head determination shall 
become final and conclusive. This finding shall be binding upon the head 
of every other executive agency in the absence of a further determination 
to the effect that new ‘npomation warrants a rehearing of the individualts 
case. | 
Section 43 provides for transfer and suspension of civilian employees. 
I ghould note that Public Law 733, Slst Congress, which is the basis of 
the current security program, requires suspension without pay where derog~ 
atory information is developed before an employee can be given a hearing 
or terminated. Under the provisions of Section 43 where a screening of- 
ficer receives information which indicates that reasonable doubt may exist 
as to loyalty of an employee occupying a sensitive position, an effort 
would first be made to transfer that employee without xdaustaen in salary 
toa non-sensitive position within the agency. If there is no vacancy 
permiting such transfer, the employes would De suspended with compensation 
at his present salary rate. The investigative agency would give priority 
to the investigation of employees ihe have been transferred or suspended. 
Tf the determination by the head of the agency following a hearing is 


favorable to a transferred or suspended employee, he shall be returned to 


Approved For Release 2001/03/07 :161A-RDP91 -00965R000500030008-5 


a 


Approved For Release 2001/03/07 : CIA-RDP91-00965R000500030008-5 


his regular position. Tf the determination is unfavorable to such 
employee and there ie timely application for review by the Central 

Review Board, the employee shall be suspended without compensation 
pending final determination by the agency head following such review. 
Where an individual has been so suspended without compensation and the 
head of the agency determines that reasonable doubt of loyalty does not 
exist, he shall be restored and paid a sum equal to the amount of com 
pensation he would have received for the period of his suspension reduced 
by the net amount of compensation he actually received for personal 
services during the suspension period. 

One of the unfortwmate requirements of the present program is the 
requirement of mandatory suspension without pay» Hundreds of employees 
who were summarily suspended under the law have been reinstated with 
resulting hardship to the employee and expense to the Gavernment. The 
Commission's recommendations as embodied in this section, by providing 
for a transfer, if possible, to a non-sensitive position and by suspension 
without pay only where there has been initial finding of reasonable doubt 
of loyalty, should therefore benefit both our Federal personnel and the 

. Government. . 

Section 44 provides that the case of any civilian employee or applicant 
whose loyalty has been adjudicated or readjudicated under the provisions 
of Fxecutive Order 10450, upon which the present security program is based, 
shall not be readjudicated under the provisions of this proposed legisla- 
tion in the basence of new evidence. The purpose of this section is to 
eliminate the further harassment of individuals who have already been 


processed,

Chapter 5 establishes the procedures to be observed in the Indus 
trial Personnel Security Programs. Every Executive agency engaged in 
the procurement of goods or gervices from Government contractors shall, 
if such procurement involves access by contractor representatives to 
classified information material, or to a security facility, establish 
and administer a security program to prevent access by untrustworthy 
individuals to such information, materiel, or facility. 

Provision is made that any such Government contractor shall enter 

. into a security agreement under which the contractor will be obliged to 
withhold from any individual acceas to information and security facilities 
of any classification unless that individual holds a security clearance. 
The contractor must also dviaeupapate in any sub-contracts such security 
provisions as may be prescribed in the original security agreement with 
“the ‘contracting ageney. .

tives. cacbiiee-qacuetey clearance shall not be geanted for accesa to

unless a National Apdhee check has been meals ir such check discloses

subversive information during such investigation will again necessitate 
the referral of the case for a full field investigation. 

Section 52 provides for the evaluation of personnel investigations 
under the industrial security program. ‘The procedure is substantially 
similar to the procedure previously described in connection with the 
evaluation of personnel investigations under the civilian loyalty program. 
Provision is Teas for each case to be screened by specially qualified 

| eee as for the individual in question to be granted the opportunity 
for an interview, and for the tranamd ssion of an appropriately detailed 
letter of charges. 

Section 53 provides for security hearings and determinations. The 
procedures here are also substantially similar to the procedures set forth 
‘in Section 42 meherding civilian employee loyalty hearings and determina~

‘adverse 2 agency head. determination and for final determination by the agency 
head. Such final determination shal be Pinding upon the heads of all 

Executive agencies. 

Chapter 6 is concerned with the designation of subversive onganiza- 

tions by the Attornsy General. ‘The Commission felt that the use of such 
a list is a necessary part of the investigative process in connection 
with the various loyalty and security programs. Were such a list not 
available, the Attorney General would still be obligated to advise the 
various department s and agencies as to the character of Organizations to 
which employees or applicants for employment belong or have belonged in 
the past. The Commission also felt, however, that it should sharply

Sections 60 through 66 of the Bills embody the Commission's recom~

tion to be given to the organization in question. 

Section 62 provides for the notice the organization may file with 
the Attorney General indicating its desire to contest the proposed 
designation. 

‘Section 63 provides that the Attorney General shall transmit to the 
organization a statement of the grounds for the proposed designation and

Central Security Office and following such hearing the Attomey General 
shall make his determination. If no timely application for such a hearing 
“ig made, the Attorney General may proceed and make a final determination. 

Section 65 provides procedures for a review of unfavorable determina- 
tions by the Attorney General. Upon the filing of timely application for 
such a review, the Attomey General shall forward the application and all 
documents and records pertaining thereto to the Director, for review by 
the Central Review Board. On receipt of the advisory report of that “oard,

a hearing and an unfavoraPle determination, timely application for review 
is not made, such determination shall Decome final upon the expiration of

Section 66 provides that any final determination made by the Attorney 
General in conformity with the provisions of this Chapter shall be con- 
clusive and may not be questioned or reviewed by any officer, Executive 
agency or court. 

Chapter 7, Section 70 (a) sets forth the basic loyalty standard; 
namely, "No individual may be appointed, employed, or retained as a. 
civilian employee if, upon all information, there is.reasonaPle doubt

Section 70 (b) sets forth the criteria which may Ye considered by 
the appropriate security personnel and agency heads in determining whether 
there is reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of any individual. As indi- 


- cated in section 70 (co), the suggested criterla are not all inclusive.

They are ae forth merely as guide lines for officials in carrying out 
their responsibilities. 

Much controversy has arisen in the past concerning the significance 
to be given to the membership of individuals in or the association of 
individuals with certain organizations. The evaluation of stich associa~ 
tions is a difficult task requiring skill and experience in security _ 
matters. For the assistance of agency heads and their security personnel, 
the. Commission recommended certain additional considerations which should 


be taken into account in making. such a judgment, and these considerations 


‘are set forth in section 70 (d). 

Section 71 (a) sets forth the basic security esnaaed to be observed 
in connection with the various industrial security programs; namely, that 
: security clearance will not be granted "if it is determined in accordance 
with the provisions of this Act, on the Pasis of all information, that 
his possession of such dlearance will endanger the common defense and 
security." | 

You will note that the basic standard with regard to industrial 
security programs is a security standard whereas the standard for Federal 
civilian employees is A loyalty standard. The reason for the distinction 
is as follows: 
| Under the donuid gatoa Ys recommendations, the loyalty program 

would ‘Dg complemented by the regular suitaPility program which is 

the basis of the Federal personnel system. Jt was felt, as I 

indicated previously, that distinction should be made Bet acel 

loyalty and other suitability considerations, 

The proPlem of granting a security clearance, however, involves 


both. loyalty and suitability considerations which the contracting agency

s 


Approved For Release 2001/03/07 : CIA-RDP91-00965R000500030008-5 
must senstien jointly. There are certain suitability disqualifications 
quite apart from the question of loyalty which would render an individual 
unfit to be granted access to classified information or security facili- 
ties. The Commission felt that under these conditions the standard as 
recommended would be the most workable. 

Section 71 (b) sets forth the criteria which may be considered in 
determining whether the possession of a security. clearance will endanger 
the common defense or security. The criteria are ginitar to those set 
Forth with regard to the civilian Loyalty program except that certain 
suitability faetors have been included. 

Chapter 8 details some of the special procedures to be followed in 
loyalty and security hearings, the most important of which are: 

le that the determination whether any applicant shall be entitled 
to a hearing or the determination of questions presented by any letter | 
of charges filed for a hearing shall be governed by the law or executive 
order applicable o the particular progran. 

2. That priority of hesring shall be given to cases which involve 
suspension from duty of civilian employees because of the existence of 
doubt as to their Toyaliys 

3. That an examiner shall have the power of a distiict court of 
‘the United States to issue procéss to compel witnesses to appear ard 
testify and to compel the production of obher evidence. This right of 


subpoena is subject to certain qualifications to which I will refer later.

A. That the individual charged may be represented at his own 
expense by counsel. 

5. That, while the rules of evidence applied by courts need not be 
applied in hearings, nevertheless the evidence shall mot be received unless 
it is relevant to one or more of the allegations in the letter of charges, 

be That the individual charged may wesent evidence and rebuttal 
evidence in his own behalf which may include evidence as to his character 

. and reputation as well as his demonstrated appreciation of the need for 
the protection of the national security. This latter point is Significant 
particularly in security hearings. The Comission felt that an individual's 
positive contribution to the national security should be considered along 
with any factors which may indicate that his access to classified informa« 
tion materiel or security facilities may endanger the national security. 

7» Only the examiner, personally assigned for official duty at a 
hearing, the party charged, counsel for the individual and the Government 
and witnesses may be present at a hearing. The Conmission felt that the 
informal atmosphere of hearings thus restricted is more conducive to an 
impartial determination of the facts. Whatever advantages open hearings 
might offer in protecting the individual's rights have been adequately 
provided for in the many procedural safeguards afforded the individuals 
under the oxopoued loyalty and security programs. 

8. A verbatim, stenopraphic transcript of all proceedings would 
be made. 

9.. At the conclusion of a hearing the exaniner would prepare a 


written report which would contain a recitation of the questions involved,

a suuaey of the evidence received, findings of fact as to each 
allegation and conclusions. The Commission felt it should be mandatory 
that the examiner prepare findings of fact. Requiring the hearing 
examiner to prepare findings of fact will insure that the examiner has 
actually based his decision on the facts. 

10, The report would be forwarded to the Mrector of the Central 
Security Office whe would transmit it to the head of the executive agency 
concerned, 

11. Confrontation would be provided in larger measure than ever 
before. In brief, it would be allowed to the maximum extent consistent 
with the protection of the national security. Only regularly established 
confidential informants furnishing Government intelligence and security 
information would be excepted. Even where confrontation is not permitted 
the substance of the information from such sources and evaluations of the 
reliability of the sources by the investigative agencies would be put in 
the hearing record, Ali other persons who have furnished information 
would be obliged to appear to personally testify or to give a deposition, 
or their information would be excluded. If an identified source of 
information is unavailable because of death, incompetency, or other reason, 
such information may “be considered by the examiner but with due regard for 
the lack of apeenwini ey for sina ceaions 

12. Both the Government and the individual charged would be permitted 
to subpoena witnesses if the evidence sought is relevant and not merely 
cumulative except regularly established confidential informants or 
identified informants who have furnished information on condition they 
not be called. If, as I indicated previously, an identified informant 


does not submit to subpoena or to furnishing information by deposition

Subpoena power hitherto has bean unknowm in the Federal ‘loyalty

been made wherety the Government would bear the travel and per diem costa 
of witnesses subpoenaed by an individual in the event he is finally

Chapter 9 sets forth the procedures for review and final determine 
atdon applicable to all loyalty and security programs, It should be 
noted that the review of any cage would be limited to an examination of 
the report of the examiner in that case and the record of proceedings 
in the hearing before the examiner. Any member of the three-man Central 
Review Board who does not concur in the recommendation made by the 
majority may prepare a separate raport, The report of the Beard and 
ithe separate report of any dissenting merber will be forwarded to the

This amendment would require the establishment, within the Office 
of the Secretary of Defense, of a new operating office to achieve con~ 
solidation of the industrial security programs of the three armed services 
into a single, integrated program, controlled, supervised, and operated by 
an Office of Security. 

Under this proposal, there would be a single set of regulations 
_which would cover all the security aspects of the armed forces indus~ 
trial security program. 

Security personnel, including inspectors would be transferred from 
the Army, Navy and Air Force to work under and be subject to the Office 
of Security in the Office of the Secretary of Defense for purposes of 
implementing this program. 

In order to insure maximum uniformity, the industrial security 
provisions of any contract should be subject to approval of the proposed 
Office of Securitys 

A single office dealing directly with industry would climinate 
duplications, confusion, delay, waste of time and money. Industry is | 
overwhelmingly in favor of dealing with a single office within the 
arwed forces and the Commission believes this can only be accomplished 
by the location of such an office as an operating unlit in the Office of 
the Secretary of Nefenses 

Section 101 recommends amending the Atomlc Energy Act of 1951, to 
permit security clearances for contractor representatives under the

Section 103 provides for the issuance of jrocess by the Inter- 

. national Organizations Employees Loyalty Board, The Commission studied 
the operations of this Board and proposed certain recommendations for 
changes in its report. As indicated previously, subpoena power hereto- 
fore has not been provided in loyalty and security hearings. Section 103 
would permit the Board to administer oaths for the taking of evidence, 
issue subpoenas to compel witnesses to appear and testify and to compel 
the production of evidence, and to appoint any person to take a deposition 
upon oral examination or written interrogatorics. 

Section 10 refers to the Veterans! Preference Act of 19h). 

H.R. 8322 and 8323 propose to amend both the Veterans' Preference Act 
of 191) and the Lioyd La¥ollette Act of August 2h, 1912. H.R. 8334 
proposes to amend only the Veterans! Preference Act of 19h. 

The Commission recommendation is in agreement with House Lill 833) 
in that it proposes to amend only Sections Yh and 15 of the Veterans! 
Preference Act. 

Under existing legislation the present practice in brief is as 
follows: When a question of an employee's suitability arises, the 
matter, if the employee is not a veteran, is handled by the mrticular 
agency in accordance with requirements of law and the regulations of the 
Civil Service Commission. The final soctel oa rests with the head of the 
agency. Under Section 1) of the Veterans! Preference Act, however, 
adverse decisions of agency heads may be appealed to the Civil Service 
Commission by preference eligible veterans. The decision of the 


Conmission is mandatory on the head of the agency.

The daniteeten on Government Security feels that the provisions 
of Section Ly not only provide a needless adiwinistrative burden but 
in eliminating the authority of the agency head violate ood personnel 
practice and weaken our entire ten of administration. 

ft should be very clearly understood that the Commission recom- 
mendation is not taking anything away from veterans that has been granted 
them in the way of employment privileges by the Congress on behalf of a 
grateful nation. It merely recommends that the responsible official of 
an agency should have the authority to determine whether an employee is 
or is not unsuitable for retention in the service. At the present time. 

- the Civil Service Comrd.ssion has that authority. 

The Commission felt that veterans and nonveterans should be afforded 
equality of treatment where aiaves of unsuitability Haws heen made, that 
itis violative of sound personnel management to vest in an outside agency 
the final decision as to retention of sitios ses charged with being un» 
suitable. Surely the responsible official of any agency, in or out of 
government should have the final authority to remove or suspend employees, 
upon whom he has to depend to perform his duties in a satisfactory manners 
The provisions of Section 1) of the Veterans! Preference Act make the 
decisions of agency and department heads mere formalities. In this 
connection, I might add that esiearee Conmission reached the same 
conclusion with the observation that it leads to working situations 
which are intolerable. 

The Commission felt that this nates should: be een to the 


attention of the Congress for a reexamination, It is the responsibility

of vs Cohen to detormine basic Federal personnel policies in the 
interest of sound administration, The Commission deliberated the 
alternative to amending Section 1h as it relates to employees of the 
Executive Branch of Government and after careful study arrived at the 
considered opinion that it would be contrary to sound principle and at 
best an expedient compromise to extend the procedures of Section Uy, to 
all. employees. We, therefore, strongly urge the Congress to follow our 
recommendation as spelled out in H.R. 633. 

I wold like to point out that there is no conflict between the 
Commission recommendation in this instance and the recommendation for 
hearings and appeals to the proposed Central Security Office. It should 
be borne in mind that the recommendations of the hearing examiners and 
the appeals board are to be advisory only to the head of an ayency or 
department. Under the present procedure established by Section 1) the 
aii Service Commission has final authority over the head of any agency 

_, Section 105 would repeal Public Law 733, the Act of August 26, 1950, 
which is the legal basis for the present security program for civiltan . 
employees. Public Law. 733, in brief, provides for the. summary suspension 
and termination of an employee of designated agencies whenever the head of 
an agency shall determine such termination necessary or advisable in the 
| interest of the national security of the United States. The provisions 

of this statute were extended to #11 employees by Executive Order 10,50, 

dated April Dae 1953. The Supreme Court limited the provisions of the 
basic act and the Executive Order, in the case of Cole v. Young by pro- 


viding that Public Law 733 is applicable to persons in sensitive positions

Public Law 733 is no longer necessary and should be repealed.
