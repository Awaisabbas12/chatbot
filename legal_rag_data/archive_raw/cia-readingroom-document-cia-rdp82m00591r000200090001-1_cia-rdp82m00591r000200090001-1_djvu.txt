MEMORANDUM FOR: Special Assistant to the DCI 
for Compartmentation 


FROM: Lee etal 
Executive oecretary 


SUBJECT Single Non-Disclosure Agreement 


1. This responds to your memorandum dated 27 March 1980 
asking for views on recording compartmented accesses granted 
individuals after they had signed APEX Non-Disclosure 
Agreements. 


2. Discussions leading to the Final Report covered 
this issue. The consensus was that signature of access 
forms would not be necessary after execution of non- 
disclosure agreements. A corollary consensus was that 
STOs, as part of their responsibility for certifying needs 
for access, would be responsible for seeing that access 
changes were appropriately recorded. Implicit in this was 
recognition that SIOs could require signature on access 
forms within their own departments as an exercise of their 
administrative authority. A sub-set of this consensus was 


that access to elopment projects within departments 
(e.g., numbered would be recorded outside 
the APEX system by project managers using whatever adminis- 


trative procedures they wished. When and rf the project 
became a Community effort, it would come under APEX and 
have toe conform to APEX rules for non-disclosure agreements 
and access records.

3. From a security administrative point of view, it 
does not seem necessary for the system to require subjects 
to sign forms acknowledging more or different accesses after 
the initial ones which triggered signature on APEX Non- 
Disclosure Agreements. However, in view of the strongly 
held views of some departments and agencies on this issue, 
we would have no objection to the APEX system specifying 
use of a short written record such as described in 
paragraph 4 of your memorandum. If this approach is 
taken, we suggest that the form prescribed be made exclusive, 
so as to avoid the possibility of SIOs requiring signatures 
on access forms which are themselves essentially the same 
as non-disclosure agreements.
