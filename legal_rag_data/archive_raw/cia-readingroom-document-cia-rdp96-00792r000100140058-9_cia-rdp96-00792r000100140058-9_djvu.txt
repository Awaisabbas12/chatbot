Sole Source Justification 
for 
Novel Intelligence Collection Techniques 
(GRILL FLAME) 
with 
SRI International 


(S) In order to fulfill the objective of this statement of work, which 
is to investigate in detail certain psychcenergetic phenomena that have 
potential military applications, the contractor is required to have both 
a high degree of technical competence in the analysis and evaluation of 
psychoenergetic phenomena such as remote viewing and psychokinetics, 

and reliability and security clearances necessary to evaluate the app- 
licability to military purposes by comparing reported phenomena to 
actually verifiable observed phenomena (which might be very highly 
classified). a 


(S) While there are other contractors or educational institutions avail- 
able with the potential to scientifically evaluate the phenomena, the 
personnel involved would not have the deptn of background offered by 

SRI nor would they possess the requisite securi~y clearances. For an- 
other contractor to acquire both personnel and expertise would be pro- 
hibitive in time and expense to the government. Additionally, SRI, a 
recognized leader in this field of analysis, has performed similar work 
for other U.S. Government agencies and has @ unique, classified data 
base which has commingled both government and proprietary data that is 
absolutely essential for the successful completion of this contract. 


(S) For the above reasons, SRI International of Menlo Park, CA, is the 
only source for contracting for this study.

JUSTIFICATION FOR SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT (U) 


1. (S) SRI International is uniquely qualified for this sole source 
procurement by virtue of a combination of experience and performance. 


2. (S/NOFORN) SRI International is a recognized leader in the field of 
psychoenergetics and has performed similar work for other U.S. Government 
agencies over the past few years. Previous work, under DIA contracts 
MDA-908-81-C-0292 and MDA~-908-92-C-0034 has formed a highly meaningful 
data base which will greatly enhance the value and effectiveness of 

this new contractural effort. 


3.. (S) The effort involved for a new contractor to research the same 
level of capability and expertise that SRI currently possesses for this 
area would be too time consuming and uneconomical to acquire and develop. 
To acquaint a new contractor in this area of expertise, if he could be 
found, would require several years simply to achieve the present level 
of expertise and competence possessed by SRI International.

J. (S) SRI International is uniquely qualified for this sole source procurement 


by virtue of a combination of experience and performance both on past efforts and 
on current contract, FY 81 S&T Project: Novel Intelligence Collection Techniques 
(GRILL FLAME). : ; 7 


2. (S) SRI International has a high degree of technical competence in the analysis 
and evaluation of audio/semantic techniques and target acquisition. It is a recog- 
nized leader in the field of psychoenergetics and has performed similar work for 
other ‘I.S. Government agencies over the past few years.

3. ...; Work proposed in this amendment is not severable from the existing FY 81 
S&T Project: Novel Intelligence Collection Technique (GRILL FLAME) contract be- 
cause work on both contracts are very similar and interrelated. Previous work, 
under DIA contract DNA 001-78-C-0274 and FY 81 S&T Project: Novel Intelligence 
Collection Technique (GRILL FLAME) has formed a highly meaningful data base which 
will greatly enhance the value and effectiveness of this new contractural effort. 


4, (S) The effort involved for a new contractor to research the same level of 


capability and expertise that SRI currently possesses for this area of analysis 
and evaluation would be too time consuming and uneconomical to acquire and de- 
velop. To acquaint a new contractor in this area-of expertise, if he could be ~ 
found, would require several years simply to achieve the present level of exper- 
tise and competence possessed by SRI International. Consequently, it has been de- 
termined that to amend the basic DIA contract would be much more efficient than 
starting a new, separate Army contract. ,

STATEMENT OF WORK: NOVEL INTELLIGENCE 
COLLECTION TECHNIQUES (PSYCHOENERGETICS- 
THREAT TO US AND POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS) 


i SG8neral 


The objective of this effort is to investigate in detail certain 
psychoenergetic phenomena that have potential military applications. 
Emphasis will be on evaluating application potential and limitations of 
such phenomena, and to provide such knowledge as gained under this 


contract to appropriate DoD agencies who will evaluate the significance 


of foreign work, particularly as it may pose a threat to the US. 


Major emphasis will be on evaluating remote viewing phenomena and 
in particular, targeting aspects, via coordinate or other methods. 
Related to this are training methods, methods of enhancing reliability 
ang repeatability of the phenomena. 


2.0 Specific Tasks (FY 81) 


2.1 Evaluate threat potential of foreign remote viewing - type 
investigations: 


2.1.1 Simulate experimental results for which there is data to 
assess validity of the foreign research. 


2.1.2 Assess military applications potential of the foreign research 
(or claims), particularly where a threat to US security is possible. 


2.1.3 Assess feasibility of the most significant applications and 
evaluate limitations. 


2.1.4 Evaluate the use of remote viewing to locate target objects 
or people. 


2.1.5 Evaluate the use of remote viewing for event detection and to 
locate events. 


2.1.6 Evaluate the use of remote viewing to detect the presence or 
absence of targets. 


2.1.7 Evaluate the potential of various camouflage, concealment and 
deception as countermeasures to remote viewing. 


2.1.8 Investigate the effects of the following variables on the remote 


viewing phenomena. (a) accuracy. (b) degree of resolution. (c) affect on 
the sensory inputs (feel, smell, touch, etc.).

REPORTS 


\ 


1.3. These reports will present a concise and factual discussion 
of findings and accomplishments during the period and must include 
appropriate references. 


2.7 Each report will include a report summary. This summary. 
prominently identified, should normally not exceed a few pages. The 
purpose of the projects must be specified, together with a description 
of important equipment purchased or developed, if any, and the 
conclusions reached by the contractor. The most important single 
feature of this summary is that it must be meaningful to readers who 
are not specialists in the subject matter of the contract. 


3. The requirement for careful preparation cannot be overemphasized 
as this summary will often provide the basis for decision on the 
continuity of the project. The contractor must recognize that his 
achievements are quite often surveyed by Department of Defense staff 
who function at a level that precludes a thorough review of detailed 
reports. 


4, When appropriate, references should be made to more detailed 
sections of the report in order to guide those wno may be prepared to 
spend the additional time required to develop a more complete and 
professional understanding of the accomplishments. 


5. The report summary should include the following information for 
each major portion of the work. 


a. Problems. 


b. General methodology (e.g.. literature view, laboratory 
experiment, survey, field study, etc.). 


c. Results 
d. Implications for further research (if any).

(9) No study will be conducted if there is any inherent reason to believe 
that death or disabling injury is likely to occur. Sufficient animal or laboratory 
experiments, or other evaluations, must have been completed to give assurance of 
acceptable risks prior to the use of human subjects. 


(10) The degree of risk to be taken will never exceed that which is 
justified by the benefit to the subject and/or the humanitarian importance of 
the knowledge to be gained. ; 


(11) A physician will be responsible for the medical care of subjects. 
Even if not the project leader, the physician will have authority to terminate 
the study at any time that he believes death, injury or hare is likely to result. 


(12) Proper preparations will be made, and adequate facilities provided, 
to protect the subject against all foreseeable possibilities of injury, disability, 
or death. This includes but is not limited to hospitalization and medical treatmen 
as may be required. In addition, all apparatus and instruments necessary to deal 
with likely emergency situations will be available. 


(13) Human subjects will have no physical or mental conditions which will 
make participation more hazardous for them than it would be for normal healthy 
persons, unless such condition is a necessary prerequisite for the particular 
study involved. In any such case, the use of human subjects with such pre-existing 
conditions must have been specifically described and justified in the scope of the 
work to be performed under this contract. 

(14) The scientifically qualified person conducting the study, and each 
menber of his research team, will be prepared to terminate the subject's partici- 
pation at any stage if he has reason to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, 
superior skill, and careful judgment required of him, that continuation is likely 
to result in injury, disability, or death to the human subject. 


(c) The Contractor, before permitting any person to participate as a human 
subject, whether at risk or not, shall insure that the following minimum conditions 
are complied with: 


(1) Legally effective informed consent will be obtained by adequate 
and appropriate methods in accordance with the provisions of this clause. 


(2) All consent must be voluntary. It must be the knowing consent of 
the individual or his legally authorized representative, so situated as to be able 
to exercise free power of choice without there having been any use of force, fraud, 
deceit, duress, constraint, coercion, or lawful or improper inducement. The ele- 
ments of information necessary to such consent include: 


. (1) A fair explanation of the procedures to be followed, and their 
purposes, including identification of any procedures which are experimental. 


(11) A description of any attendant discomforts or risks reasonably 
to be anticipated. .
