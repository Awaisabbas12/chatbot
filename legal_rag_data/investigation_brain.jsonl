It contains data\nfrom about 150 users, mostly senior management of Enron,\norganized into folders.  The corpus contains\na total of about 0.5M messages.\nThis data was originally\nmade\npublic, and posted to the web\n, by the\nFederal Energy Regulatory\nCommission\nduring its investigation.\nThe email dataset was later purchased by\nLeslie\nKaelbling\nat MIT, and turned out to have a number of integrity\nproblems.  A number of folks at SRI, notably\nMelinda Gervasio\n,\nworked hard to correct these problems, and it is thanks to them\n(not me) that the dataset is available.  The dataset here does not\ninclude attachments, and some messages have been deleted \"as part\nof a redaction effort due to requests from affected\nemployees\". Invalid email addresses were converted to something of\nthe form user@enron.com whenever possible (i.e., recipient is\nspecified in some parse-able format like \"Doe, John\" or \"Mary\nK. Smith\") and to no_address@enron.com when no recipient was\nspecified.\nI get a number of questions about this corpus each week, which\nI am unable to answer, mostly because they deal with preparation\nissues and such that I just don't know about.  If you ask me a\nquestion and I don't answer, please don't feel slighted.\nI am distributing this dataset as a resource for researchers\nwho are interested in improving current email tools, or\nunderstanding how email is currently used.  This data is valuable;\nto my knowledge it is the only substantial collection of \"real\"\nemail that is public.  The reason other datasets are not public is\nbecause of privacy concerns. In using this dataset, please be\nsensitive to the privacy of the people involved (and remember that\nmany of these people were certainly not involved in any of the\nactions which precipitated the investigation.)\nPrior versions of the dataset\nare\nno longer\nbeing distributed.\nIf you are using the\nMarch 2, 2004 Version; the August 21, 2009 Version;\nor the April 2, 2011 Version of this dataset for\nyour work, you are requested to replace it with the newer\nversion of the dataset below, or make\nthe\nthe appropriate changes\nto\nyour local copy.\nMay 7, 2015 Version\nof dataset\n(about 1.7Gb, tarred and gzipped).\nThere are also several on-line databases that allow you to\nsearch the data, at\nUCB\n, and\nwww.enron-mail.com\nResearch uses of the dataset\nThis is a partial and poorly maintained list. If I've left your\nwork out, don't take it personally, and feel free to send me a\npointer and/or description.\nA paper\ndescribing the Enron data\nwas presented at the 2004\nCEAS conference.\nSome experiments associated with this data are described on\nRon Bekkerman\n's home\npage.\nA social-network analysis of the data, including\n\"useful mappings\nbetween the MD5 digest of the email bodies and such things as\nauthors, recipients, etc\"\n, is available from\nAndres\nCorrada-Emmanuel\n.\nA group from\nSIMS,\nUC Berkeley\nprovides search, visualization, and some email\nthat has been labeled with topic and sentiment labels\nJitesh\nShetty\nhas put up a database of link-analysis results.\nA\nversion of the dataset with all attachments\nis available\nfrom\nEDRM\n.\nWork at the University of Pennsylvania includes\na query dataset\nfor email search as well as a tool for generating spelling\nerrors\nbased on the Enron corpus.\nKimmie Farrington and colleagues published a paper in 2011\nthat uses the Enron dataset as part of the test corpus for their\nwork on crowdsourcing human vs. computer generated\nclassification explanation: see Hutton, Amanda, Alexander Liu,\nand Cheryl Martin. \"Crowdsourcing evaluations of classifier\ninterpretability.\" In\nProceedings of the 2012 AAAI Spring\nSymposium on Wisdom of the Crowd\nParakweet\nhas\nreleased\nan\nopen\nsource set of Enron sentence data, labeled for speech\nacts.\nA set\nof\nsentence\nlevel annotations (of what requires action or response from\nuser)\nhas been released by Charlie Oxborough.\nWilliam W.
