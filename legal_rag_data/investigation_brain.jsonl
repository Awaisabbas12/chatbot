It contains data from about 150 users, mostly senior management of\nEnron, organized into folders. The corpus contains a total of about 0.5M\nmessages. This data was originally made public, and posted to the web, by the\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation. The email\ndataset was later purchased by Leslie Kaelbling at MIT, and turned out to have\na number of integrity problems. A number of folks at SRI, notably Melinda\nGervasio, worked hard to correct these problems, and it is thanks to them (not\nme) that the dataset is available. The dataset here does not include\nattachments, and some messages have been deleted \"as part of a redaction\neffort due to requests from affected employees\". Invalid email addresses were\nconverted to something of the form user@enron.com whenever possible (i.e.,\nrecipient is specified in some parse-able format like \"Doe, John\" or \"Mary K.\nSmith\") and to no_address@enron.com when no recipient was specified. I get a\nnumber of questions about this corpus each week, which I am unable to answer,\nmostly because they deal with preparation issues and such that I just don't\nknow about. If you ask me a question and I don't answer, please don't feel\nslighted. I am distributing this dataset as a resource for researchers who are\ninterested in improving current email tools, or understanding how email is\ncurrently used. This data is valuable; to my knowledge it is the only\nsubstantial collection of \"real\" email that is public. The reason other\ndatasets are not public is because of privacy concerns. In using this dataset,\nplease be sensitive to the privacy of the people involved (and remember that\nmany of these people were certainly not involved in any of the actions which\nprecipitated the investigation.) Prior versions of the dataset are no longer\nbeing distributed. If you are using the March 2, 2004 Version; the August 21,\n2009 Version; or the April 2, 2011 Version of this dataset for your work, you\nare requested to replace it with the newer version of the dataset below, or\nmake the the appropriate changes to your local copy. May 7, 2015 Version of\ndataset (about 1.7Gb, tarred and gzipped). There are also several on-line\ndatabases that allow you to search the data, at UCB, and www.enron-mail.com\nResearch uses of the dataset This is a partial and poorly maintained list. If\nI've left your work out, don't take it personally, and feel free to send me a\npointer and/or description. A paper describing the Enron data was presented at\nthe 2004 CEAS conference. Some experiments associated with this data are\ndescribed on Ron Bekkerman's home page. A social-network analysis of the data,\nincluding \"useful mappings between the MD5 digest of the email bodies and such\nthings as authors, recipients, etc\", is available from Andres Corrada-\nEmmanuel. A group from SIMS, UC Berkeley provides search, visualization, and\nsome email that has been labeled with topic and sentiment labels Jitesh Shetty\nhas put up a database of link-analysis results. A version of the dataset with\nall attachments is available from EDRM. Work at the University of Pennsylvania\nincludes a query dataset for email search as well as a tool for generating\nspelling errors based on the Enron corpus. Kimmie Farrington and colleagues\npublished a paper in 2011 that uses the Enron dataset as part of the test\ncorpus for their work on crowdsourcing human vs. computer generated\nclassification explanation: see Hutton, Amanda, Alexander Liu, and Cheryl\nMartin. \"Crowdsourcing evaluations of classifier interpretability.\" In\nProceedings of the 2012 AAAI Spring Symposium on Wisdom of the Crowd Parakweet\nhas released an open source set of Enron sentence data, labeled for speech\nacts. A set of sentence level annotations (of what requires action or response\nfrom user) has been released by Charlie Oxborough. William W.

The FTC also alleges that Asbury discriminates against Black and Latino consumers, targeting them with unwanted and higher-priced add-ons.In an administrative complaint, the FTC alleges that three Texas dealerships owned by Asbury that operate as David McDavid Ford Ft. Worth, David McDavid Honda Frisco, and David McDavid Honda Irving, along with Ali Benli, who acted as general manager of those dealerships, engaged in a variety of practices to sneak hidden fees for unwanted add-ons past consumers. These tactics included a practice called “payment packing,” where the dealerships convinced consumers to agree to monthly payments that were larger than needed to pay for the agreed-upon price of the car, and then “packed” add-on items to the sales contract to make up that difference.
